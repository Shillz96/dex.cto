## 🟣 FINAL MAINNET LAUNCH STEPS (Actionable)

These are the last-mile items to execute before flipping production traffic. They focus on consistency, correctness, and observability.

### 1) Program ID and IDL consistency
- [ ] Generate/finalize mainnet program keypair and PROGRAM_ID; record in `PROGRAM_ID_UPDATE.md`
- [ ] Set `Anchor.toml` `[programs.mainnet].cto_dex_escrow = "<MAINNET_PROGRAM_ID>"`
- [ ] Ensure `apps/web/idl/cto_dex_escrow.json.metadata.address` equals `<MAINNET_PROGRAM_ID>` (regenerate IDL after deploy if needed)
- [ ] Single source of truth: export `PROGRAM_ID=<MAINNET_PROGRAM_ID>` in `.env` used by scripts and CI
- [ ] Remove/avoid hard-coded IDs in scripts; read from env instead

### 2) Environment variables (prod)
- [ ] Backend/scripts: `SOLANA_CLUSTER=mainnet-beta`, `PROGRAM_ID`, `KEEPER_RPC_URL=<your_mainnet_rpc_url>`
- [ ] Web `apps/web/.env.local`: `NEXT_PUBLIC_PROGRAM_ID`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_RPC_URL=<your_mainnet_rpc_url>`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_USDC_MINT=<your_usdc_mint>`
- [ ] Keeper `.env`: `KEEPER_PRIVATE_KEY` (mainnet), `KEEPER_RPC_URL`, `PROGRAM_ID`, alerting webhooks (store in CI secrets)

### 3) Build, deploy, and verify (mainnet)
- [ ] `anchor build` from repo root
- [ ] `anchor deploy --provider.cluster mainnet-beta --program-keypair <program-keypair.json>`
- [ ] Verify on-chain: `solana program show <MAINNET_PROGRAM_ID> --url mainnet-beta`
- [ ] Regenerate and commit IDL if the address changed; confirm IDL `metadata.address` matches program ID
- [ ] Run `node scripts/verify-program.js` with mainnet RPC to check IDL load and program account presence

### 4) Frontend readiness
- [ ] Confirm `apps/web/lib/anchorClient.ts` consumes `NEXT_PUBLIC_PROGRAM_ID` and IDL program ID without hard-coding
- [ ] Smoke test flows on mainnet RPC with a canary campaign (tiny target)
- [ ] Check error surfaces: user-facing messages map to documented errors

### 5) Keeper readiness
- [ ] `scripts/keeper`: set mainnet env, dry-run read-only checks, then enable payouts
- [ ] Confirm hash function parity with on-chain (Keccak input ordering and endianness)
- [ ] Validate health checks: `getLatestBlockhash` timeout, circuit breaker thresholds, alert webhooks

### 6) Monitoring and alerting
- [ ] `/api/health` returns healthy in prod environment
- [ ] `/monitoring` dashboard shows program connectivity, error counts, latencies
- [ ] Alerts wired to Slack/Email/Discord; simulate a failure to verify delivery

### 7) Security and operations
- [ ] External audit or peer review sign-off captured in `docs/` (attach report or summary)
- [ ] Backup/rollback plan written and tested: previous program-id and redeploy command
- [ ] Access controls: restrict deploy keys, rotate any devnet/test keys not needed

### 8) Release and docs
- [ ] Tag release `v1.0.0-mainnet` with PROGRAM_ID and commit hash
- [ ] Update `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`/`README.md` with final IDs and RPCs
- [ ] Save runbooks: deploy, verify, emergency pause (if applicable), rollback

## 🛠 Code/config cleanups before launch

### Deploy/Verify scripts
- [ ] `scripts/deploy-program.js`: read `PROGRAM_ID`, `SOLANA_CLUSTER`, `PROGRAM_KEYPAIR` from env; remove hard-coded defaults; fail fast if missing
- [ ] `scripts/verify-program.js`: read `PROGRAM_ID` and RPC from env; verify `idl.metadata.address === PROGRAM_ID`; exit non-zero on mismatch

### Anchor/Config
- [ ] `Anchor.toml`: keep `[provider.cluster]` devnet for development, pass `--provider.cluster` on deploy; ensure `[programs.mainnet]` is set

### Web/Keeper
- [ ] Eliminate any hard-coded program IDs; centralize via env and IDL metadata

---

## ✅ Launch gate (all must be true)
- [ ] One canonical PROGRAM_ID in env, Anchor toml, IDL, web, keeper
- [ ] Program visible on mainnet; IDL metadata address matches
- [ ] Web and keeper pass smoke tests on mainnet RPC
- [ ] Monitoring green and alerts firing on simulated failures
- [ ] Rollback procedure validated
